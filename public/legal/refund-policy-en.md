# Refund Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2, 2025

At ConvertFix, we stand behind the quality of our AI-powered landing page audits. If you're not satisfied with your report, we offer a straightforward 14-day money-back guarantee.

## 1. Our Guarantee

### 1.1 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee
If you're not satisfied with your audit report for any reason, you can request a full refund within **14 days** of purchase.

**No questions asked. No lengthy explanations required.**

This applies to all three audit tiers:
- Quick Audit ($29)
- Professional Audit ($49)
- Premium Audit ($99)

## 2. How to Request a Refund

Requesting a refund is simple:

### 2.1 Contact Us
Email us at **support@convertfix.app** with:
- Your order confirmation number (or email used for purchase)
- The subject line: "Refund Request"
- Optional: Brief reason (helps us improve, but not required)

**Example email:**
```
Subject: Refund Request
Order: #12345
Email: your@email.com

I'd like to request a refund for my Professional Audit purchase.
[Optional reason: The audit didn't cover mobile optimization, which was my main concern.]
```

### 2.2 We Process Your Refund
- **Response time:** Within 24-48 hours (usually same business day)
- **Processing time:** 5-7 business days for the refund to appear in your account
- **Method:** Refund issued through Paddle to your original payment method

## 3. What Happens After a Refund

### 3.1 Report Access
Once a refund is processed:
- The PDF report will be removed from our systems
- You will no longer have access to the report
- Any download links will be deactivated

### 3.2 Re-Purchase
You are welcome to purchase a new audit at any time, even after receiving a refund. We hold no grudges!

## 4. Refund Eligibility

### 4.1 Eligible Refunds
Refunds are granted for:
- Not satisfied with audit quality
- Report didn't meet your expectations
- Technical issues that prevented proper delivery
- Any other reason - we trust you

### 4.2 Time Limit
Refunds must be requested within **14 days** of the original purchase date. After 14 days, all sales are final.

### 4.3 No Limits
There is no limit to the number of times you can request a refund (within the 14-day window for each purchase).

## 5. Exceptions and Special Cases

### 5.1 Abuse Prevention
While we trust our customers, we reserve the right to refuse refunds in cases of clear abuse, such as:
- Requesting refunds for 10+ consecutive purchases
- Downloading the report, using the recommendations, then requesting a refund
- Fraudulent payment methods

**We've never had to enforce this, and we hope to keep it that way.**

### 5.2 Technical Failures (Our Fault)
If our Service fails to deliver your report due to technical issues on our end:
- We will either fix the issue and redeliver within 24 hours, **or**
- We will issue an immediate refund (no 14-day wait required)

### 5.3 User Error (Not Our Fault)
If the report isn't delivered due to:
- Invalid email address provided
- URL not accessible (password-protected page)
- Non-English landing page (currently unsupported)

We will try to resolve the issue first. If it can't be resolved, we'll issue a refund.

## 6. Partial Refunds

We currently do **not** offer partial refunds. Refunds are always full refunds of the purchase price.

If you purchased the **Premium Audit ($99)** but feel the **Professional Audit ($49)** would have been sufficient, we'll refund the full $99 (not just the difference).

## 7. Chargebacks

### 7.1 Please Contact Us First
If you're considering filing a chargeback with your credit card company, **please contact us first** at support@convertfix.app.

Chargebacks:
- Take longer to process (30-60 days vs. 5-7 days for a regular refund)
- Incur fees for us ($15-25 per chargeback)
- Create unnecessary hassle for both parties

**We promise to resolve any issue quickly and fairly.** Give us a chance!

### 7.2 Unjustified Chargebacks
If you file a chargeback after we've already issued a refund, or without contacting us first, we may:
- Dispute the chargeback with evidence of the refund
- Restrict future purchases from your account

## 8. Currency and Exchange Rates

### 8.1 Refund Currency
Refunds are issued in the **original currency** of your purchase:
- If you paid in USD, you'll receive USD
- If you paid in PLN, you'll receive PLN
- If you paid in EUR, you'll receive EUR

### 8.2 Exchange Rate Fluctuations
If exchange rates have changed between purchase and refund, you may receive a slightly different amount in your local currency. This is handled automatically by your bank or payment processor.

## 9. Refund Timeline Summary

Here's what to expect:

| Step | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| You email refund request | Day 0 |
| We confirm receipt | Within 24 hours |
| We process refund via Paddle | Within 48 hours |
| Paddle initiates refund to your bank | 1-2 business days |
| Refund appears in your account | 5-7 business days (total) |

**In most cases, you'll see your refund within 5-7 business days.**

## 11. Our Commitment to You

We built ConvertFix to help solo founders and indie hackers improve their landing pages. If our audit doesn't deliver value, we don't want your money.

**Our philosophy:**
- Trust our customers
- Make refunds easy and fast
- Learn from feedback to improve the Service
- Build long-term relationships over short-term revenue

If you have any concerns about requesting a refund, please reach out. We're human, and we understand that not every product is the right fit for every person.

## 12. Feedback is Gold

When you request a refund, we'll ask (but not require) you to share why the audit didn't meet your needs.

**Your feedback helps us:**
- Improve our AI models
- Add missing features
- Better set customer expectations
- Create a better product for everyone

**We read every piece of feedback.** Thank you for helping us improve.

## 13. Changes to This Refund Policy

We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

If we make material changes that reduce your refund rights, we'll notify you via email (if you've made a recent purchase).
