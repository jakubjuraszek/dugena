Change from 'Revolutionary Platform for Teams' to 'Slack for Remote Teams' (7 words, clear benefit).\"\n\nPlus, free tools are lead magnets. You'll get sales calls.\n\nWe're a product, not a lead gen funnel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can AI really match a human consultant?",
        "answer": "For $29-99? Yes.\n\nOur AI analyzed 1,000+ successful launches (Basecamp, Notion, Linear, Superhuman). It learned their patterns.\n\nFor $2,000, a human might spend 10 hours custom-analyzing your niche.\n\nBut for quick wins? AI is faster and just as accurate.\n\nThink of it as \"tier 1 support\" that handles 80% of cases perfectly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my landing page is complex/technical/B2B?",
        "answer": "AI trained on every category:\nDev Tools, Enterprise SaaS, Fintech, Health Tech, Crypto.\n\nIf you're B2B SaaS, it's seen 200+ similar pages.\nIt knows your buyers care about ROI, integrations, security.\n\nComplex = more reason to audit.\nSimpler pages are easier to guess. Yours needs data."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take?",
        "answer": "60-90 seconds after you submit URL.\n\nNo waiting days for a consultant.\n\nYou'll have your PDF in your inbox before you finish your coffee."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't agree with the recommendations?",
        "answer": "Then don't implement them.\n\nWe show you data-backed patterns (e.g., \"Notion's headline is 7 words, yours is 23\").\n\nYou decide if it applies to your case.\n\nBut remember: AI analyzed 1,000+ successful launches. Patterns exist for a reason."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need coding skills to implement fixes?",
        "answer": "No.\n\n80% of fixes are copy changes:\n• Headline: Copy-paste new text\n• CTA: Change button text\n• Social proof: Add testimonial section\n\n20% are layout tweaks (move CTA higher, add pricing table).\n\nIf you use Webflow/Wix/Squarespace, you can click-and-drag.\n\nNo coding."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in the re-test?",
        "answer": "Professional: 50% off second audit after 7 days ($24.50 instead of $49).\n\nPremium: FREE re-audit within 30 days.\n\nUse it after implementing fixes to measure improvement."

      {
        "question": "Can I get a refund?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is this a one-time payment or subscription?",

        "answer": "Then you'll know it's not your landing page.\n\nIt's something else (product-market fit, traffic source, pricing).\n\nThat clarity is worth $29-99.\n\nMost founders waste months guessing.\nYou'll know in 60 seconds + 1 week of testing.\n\nPlus: 30-day money-back guarantee.\nYou risk nothing."
